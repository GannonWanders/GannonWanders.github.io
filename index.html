      <img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Project 1 Screenshot" class="project-img">
      <h3>Offline Smart Doorbell (Ring Alternative)</h3>
      <p>Built a fully offline smart video doorbell system as a cost-effective alternative to commercial products like Ring, eliminating the need for cloud access or subscription fees. Integrated a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera, motion sensor, microphone, speaker, and local storage, using Python to control hardware and manage event-triggered video recording. Gained hands-on experience in embedded systems, GPIO interfacing, and real-time data handling.</p>
      <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Embedded Systems, Raspberry Pi, GPIO, Motion sensors</p>
    </div>
